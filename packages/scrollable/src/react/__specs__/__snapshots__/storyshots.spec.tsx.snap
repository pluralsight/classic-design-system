            You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Every day I learn.

            Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy.

              You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Every day I learn. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.

              Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.

              I get carried away with this brush cleaning. What the devil. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Imagination is the key to painting.

              Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy.

              Very easy to work these to death. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate.

              We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.
