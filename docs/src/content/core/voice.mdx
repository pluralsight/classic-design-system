# Voice & tone

<Intro>
  Our writing voice is friendly, as if you’re speaking to a relative or
  colleague. We don’t want to come across as stuffy or as if we’re talking down
  to our reader, but we do want to come across as credible and knowledgeable.
  This does not mean that you should forgo basic style guidelines. But, it does
  mean that you shouldn’t be afraid to start a sentence with conjunctions like
  “but” or “and.” You should also use contractions (didn’t, don’t, haven’t,
  hadn’t) freely.
</Intro>

<Intro>
  We follow three principles in our messaging: Be confident. Be enthusiastic. Be
  clever.
</Intro>

<TableOfContents {...props} />

<EqualColumnLayout count={EqualColumnLayout.counts.three}>
  <div>
    <PrincipleHeader>Confident</PrincipleHeader>
    <P>Be simple and direct. Avoid long, hard words and formal language. Try not to say too many things at once. Avoid hedging language and evasive phrases such as “seems like” and “according to.” Steer clear of empty words like “world class,” “robust” and “high quality.”</P>
  </div>


{' '}
<div>
  <PrincipleHeader>Enthusiastic</PrincipleHeader>
  <P>
    Stay positive by avoiding comparisons designed to elevate one idea by
    diminishing another. Assume success and stay away from fear. Celebrate the
    craft. Our audience appreciates the skill that goes into their work, so
    shine light on it whenever possible.
  </P>
</div>

  <div>
    <PrincipleHeader>Clever</PrincipleHeader>
    <P>Show our audience you relate to their joys and frustrations. That you know they have interests outside of work. Infuse your writing with the unexpected and engage in wordplay but not at the expense of being clear. At times, be light-hearted but not light-headed.</P>
  </div>
</EqualColumnLayout>


## Point of view

Do write in [second person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration#Second-person),
meaning address the audience as “you,” “your,” etc. We talk to our audience
directly, addressing them as “you” not as “one,” “persons,” etc. (We want to
avoid phrases like this: “To take a skill assessment, one needs to select…”)
This language feels formal and unnatural.

> Exception: When writing copy for interactive challenges, write in the
> first-person-plural point of view instead. We write in this way to be more
> inclusive and encouraging to the learner. To show that we're on this learning
> journey with them. Read more in the [challenge writing styleguide](https://github.com/ps-dev/interactive-courses/wiki/Challenge-Writing-Styleguide).

## Capitalization & Punctuation

<EqualColumnLayout count={EqualColumnLayout.counts.two}>
  <div>
    <Heading size={Heading.sizes.medium}>
      <h3>Headlines</h3>
    </Heading>
    <P>
      Write headlines in sentence case, meaning only capitalize the first word
      and any proper nouns.
    </P>
  </div>
  <Quote>Measure your skills</Quote>
</EqualColumnLayout>

<EqualColumnLayout count={EqualColumnLayout.counts.two}>
  <P>Only punctuate a headline when it uses more than one sentence.</P>
  <Quote>Measure your skills. Learn something new.</Quote>
</EqualColumnLayout>

<EqualColumnLayout count={EqualColumnLayout.counts.two}>
  <div>
    <Heading size={Heading.sizes.medium}>
      <h3>Commas</h3>
    </Heading>
    <P>
      We do not use a serial comma, a comma in front of the conjunction
      connecting list items.
    </P>
  </div>
  <Quote>
    At Pluralsight we are big fans of pizza, Indian and Chinese food.
  </Quote>
</EqualColumnLayout>

<EqualColumnLayout count={EqualColumnLayout.counts.two}>
  <P>
    Exception: We do use a serial comma when the phrase before the conjunction
    also has a conjunction or if the phrases separated by the commas will be
    less confusing if commas are used throughout.
  </P>

    While studying for certifications, it’s important to use flash cards,
    practice tests, online or instructor-led training, and study guides.

### Exclamation points

Avoid over-using exclamation points, unless offering congratulations on having
completed a complex flow. Exclamation points aren’t a substitute for
creating excitement.

## Buttons, links and other actions

<EqualColumnLayout count={EqualColumnLayout.counts.two}>
  <P>
    Buttons should always be clear, direct and actionable. A link should be
    descriptive of the place it's taking the user. Do not use text such as
    ‘click here’, or anything that does not make sense when read out of context.
  </P>

## Error messages

Do all you can to prevent errors, but when they occur, use the opportunity to
help users understand what happened and how to get through it. Follow these 3
guidelines when writing error messages:

### 1. Explain what happened and why

Be clear about what’s going on. Give the right amount of detail, but don’t get
too technical. Write in a way that anyone could easily understand without
using jargon.

<Guideline
  do={
    <CenteredExample>
      <P>
        <strong>Your credit card has expired</strong>
      </P>
      <P>Update your payment method to restore your subscription.</P>
    </CenteredExample>
  }
  dont={
    <CenteredExample>
      <P>
        <strong>Billing Error</strong>
      </P>
    </CenteredExample>
  }
/>

### 2. Suggest a next step

After you explain what happened, tell the user what they can do to resolve the
issue. If possible include a button, a link, or another call to action.

<Guideline
  do={
    <CenteredExample>
      <P>
        <strong>There was a problem loading the video</strong>
      </P>
      <br />
      <Button>Try again</Button>
    </CenteredExample>
  }
  dont={
    <CenteredExample>
      <P>
        <strong>Error 7007</strong>
      </P>
      <P>Unable to play video</P>
    </CenteredExample>
  }
/>

### 3. Match the tone to the context

Avoid being robotic or silly. Remember, something went wrong, now's your time
to help them through it in a friendly way.

<Guideline
  do={
    <CenteredExample>
      <P>That password doesn’t match. Try again?</P>
    </CenteredExample>
  }
  dont={
    <CenteredExample>
      <P>
        Yo, big problemo! The password you provided doesn’t match. Wanna try
        that again?
      </P>
    </CenteredExample>
  }
/>

## Formatting

<EqualColumnLayout count={EqualColumnLayout.counts.two}>
  <div>
    <Heading size={Heading.sizes.medium}>
      <h3>Time</h3>
    </Heading>
    <P>
      Follow AP conventions, only listing a.m. or p.m. on one of the times
      unless the time spans both a.m. and p.m. Drop :00 from any times that
      start at the hour. Use noon or midnight vs. 12 a.m. and 12 p.m.
    </P>
  </div>
  <Quote>
    10:30 a.m.–1 p.m.
    <br />
    Noon–3 p.m.
    <br />
    1–5:30 p.m.
  </Quote>
</EqualColumnLayout>

<EqualColumnLayout count={EqualColumnLayout.counts.two}>
  <div>
    <Heading size={Heading.sizes.medium}>
      <h3>Dates</h3>
    </Heading>
    <P>
      Do not use contractions (st, th, etc.) within a complete sentence. Do not
      use leading zeros on days. Feel free to abbreviate months. Use four digit
      year.
    </P>

<EqualColumnLayout count={EqualColumnLayout.counts.two}>
  <div>

    </Heading>
    <P>For numerals over 999, insert a comma for clarity.</P>

<EqualColumnLayout count={EqualColumnLayout.counts.two}>
  <div>
    <Heading size={Heading.sizes.medium}>
      <h3>Duration</h3>
    </Heading>
    <P>
      When listing duration of long content, round to the nearest hour or
      minute, with no leading zeros. For approximate durations, round to nearest
      appropriate value. For short and exact duration, display standard time
      format, no leading zeros.

<EqualColumnLayout count={EqualColumnLayout.counts.two}>
  <div>
    <Heading size={Heading.sizes.medium}>
      <h3>Names</h3>
    </Heading>
    <P>
      When listing a single author or owner, display full name. If listing
      multiple and space is limited, abbreviating to last name only is
      acceptable. Do not use “By” in the beginning of an author(s) string.
    </P>
