# Motion

<TableOfContents {...props} />

## Speed

Motion speed should most often occur at the following standard increments.

<Speeds />

Use the CSS variables to set the duration.

```css
@import '@pluralsight/ps-design-system-core';

.mySelector {
  animation-duration: var(--ps-motion-speed-xfast);
}
```

To select a duration, use the following rules of thumb.

<Relative />

A small object moving a great relative distance may have slightly longer duration so that the movement isnâ€™t too fast and abrupt.

<Travel />

## Easing

Some general guidance on selecting an easing curve.

<Easing />

```css
@import '@pluralsight/ps-design-system-core';

.mySelector {
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}
```

## Rotation

Generally, larger objects look more natural when rotating slower than smaller objects. The easing property for rotation should be **linear**.

<Rotation />

```css
@import '@pluralsight/ps-design-system-core';

@keyframes rotateMe {
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}

.mySelector {
  animation: var(--psMotionSpeedNormal) linear infinite rotateMe;
}
```
