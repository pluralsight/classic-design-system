<Intro>
  Installation & configuration 
</Intro>

<TableOfContents {...props} />

## Asset types

There are 3 main types of code assets that the Design System will give you as a developer:

1. **Normalize** - A reset and base css stylesheet that is required in any app that uses the Design System components.
2. **Core** - A collection of basic values for color, type, layout, etc.
3. **Components** - UI Widgets

## Installation

### Install Normalize

```bash startExpanded noRender
npm install @pluralsight/ps-design-system-normalize
```

For CSS configuration options, follow the "[CSS configuration](#css-configuration)" section instructions.

### Install Core

```bash startExpanded
npm install @pluralsight/ps-design-system-core
```

If you use Core values via CSS custom properties, installing Core is not required because those properites are included in `:root` in Normalize. If, however, you want to import into JS and use the JS variables, you'll want to install Core separately.

For CSS configuration options, follow the "[CSS configuration](#css-configuration)" section instructions.

For usage options, follow the "[Core usage](#core-usage)" section instructions.

### Install components

<Badge color="yellow">Work in progress</Badge> 

We are currently converting from CSS-in-JS via Glamor to vanilla CSS.  For today, you can safely assume that [glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor) is still a peer dependency and needs to be installed exactly once per application.

```bash startExpanded
npm install glamor
```

All components support theming and have a peer dependency on the Theme package. Install with:

```bash startExpanded
npm install @pluralsight/ps-design-system-theme
```

Each component is installed separately. For example:

```bash startExpanded
npm install @pluralsight/ps-design-system-button
```

The JavaScript is compiled as ES5 and dual-published as CommonJS and ES Modules.

### Polyfills

Pluralsight still supports IE11 and compiling to ES5 doesn't solve the issue of using JS APIs that don't exist in that browser.  You will likely want to bundle a global polyfill with your application such as `core-js`. 

It will be challenging to not bloat your polyfill because what exact polyfills are needed by the Design System has not been documented well to date. For now, either including the full `core-js` or testing in IE11 is recommended.

## CSS configuration

### Webpack bundling

You'll need to include the CSS for Design System Core and components (or at least those components that have moved from Glamor to vanilla CSS).

```bash startExpanded
npm install style-loader css-loader
```

Add a loader chain for CSS to your `webpack.config.js`. Make sure it processes CSS from the installed Design System packages by including those paths. For example:

```typescript noRender startExpanded
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [{ loader: 'style-loader' }, { loader: 'css-loader' }],
        include: [
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules', '@pluralsight'),
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

### PostCSS

If you're using Core as CSS variables, you'll want to process your app css with PostCSS in order to give fallback values to CSS custom properties. Processing Design System component CSS with PostCSS is not needed because the CSS in components has already been processed and should be browser-ready.

Install the tool dependencies:

```bash startExpanded
npm install postcss-import postcss-preset-env
```

And add a `postcss.config.js`:

```typescript noRender startExpanded
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-import': {},
    'postcss-preset-env': { browsers: ['Last 2 versions', 'IE >= 11'] }
  }
}
```

For webpack bundling, install the extra loader: 

```bash startExpanded
npm install postcss-loader cssnano
```

And add `postcss-loader` to then end of your loader chain:

```typescript noRender startExpanded
use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'postcss-loader'],
```

### Sass

Core publishes Sass variables. Components with vanilla CSS publish a `.scss` stylesheet (that's identical to the `.css`) but it's not what's used internal to components. You could access it from `node_modules` if desired for your use case.

To use Sass, installed the required build tools, such as:

```bash startExpanded
npm install node-sass
```

If you use Webpack for loading CSS, you'll also need to install your additional CSS loaders:

```bash startExpanded
npm install sass-loader
```

And add the loader to the chain that processes CSS:

```typescript noRender startExpanded
use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader']
```

### Next.js

To avoid flashes of unstyled content when doing SSR with `next.js` the following is necessary:

Add `glamor/server` to the `\_document.js`:

```bash startExpanded
npm install glamor
```

```typescript noRender startExpanded
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
import { renderStatic } from 'glamor/server'
class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
    const page = ctx.renderPage()
    const styles = renderStatic(() => page.html || page.errorHtml)
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)
    return { ...initialProps, ...page, ...styles }
  }
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    const { __NEXT_DATA__, ids } = props
    if (ids) {
      __NEXT_DATA__.ids = this.props.ids
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <Html lang="en-US">
        <Head>
          <style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: this.props.css }} />
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    )
  }
}
export default MyDocument
```

In `next.config.js` directly adjust postCSS configuration like so:

```bash startExpanded
npm install @pluralsight/ps-design-system-core
```

<Badge color={Badge.colors.yellow}>Note</Badge> CSS variables consumed by app need
to be added to import from field.

```typescript noRender startExpanded
const postcssPresetEnv = require('postcss-preset-env')
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('postcss-import')(),
    postcssPresetEnv({
      stage: 2,
      features: {
        'nesting-rules': true
      },
      browsers: ['Last 2 versions', 'IE >= 11'],
      importFrom: [
        './node_modules/@pluralsight/ps-design-system-core/css/colors.module.css',
        './node_modules/@pluralsight/ps-design-system-core/css/type.module.css',
        // etc
      ]
    })
  ]
}
```

### Configuration examples

See the [examples on Github](https://github.com/pluralsight/design-system/tree/master/examples/) for config in project context.

## Core usage

After, installation, use Core in the flavor of your choice. JavaScript or CSS are equally recommended.

### Import JavaScript

```typescript noRender startExpanded
import * as core from '@pluralsight/ps-design-system-core'

<button style={{ backgroundColor: core.colorsPink[6] }}>Click</button>
```

### Import CSS

To use the Core variables in CSS:

```css noRender startExpanded
.mySelector {
  color: var(--ps-colors-pink-6);
}
```

Importing the Core package is not required because Normalize should already be on every page.

### Import SASS

To use the Core variables in SASS:

```css noRender startExpanded
@import '~@pluralsight/ps-design-system-core/dist/index.module.scss';

.mySelector {
  color: $ps-colors-pink6;
}
```

## Overriding component styles

### Use the standard

The Design System is meant, among other things, to provide continuity of the user experience across Pluralsight products. But sometimes it will make sense to override a visual standard. This should not be the common case. And it should be done by product designers and developers who are clear about the tradeoffs and have a clear rationale of the value that such an override would create. If the value add isn't significant, the standard should be kept.

### Limit the effects of overrides

Design System component CSS is not modularized. This is so that targetting and overriding become simple. But it does come with tradeoffs. In a way, it's going back to the olden days. Now the CSS for Design System components all lives in the global namespace of a web page. Thus we all need to be careful to be a good citizens and not unintentionally clobber the styles of other things. Limit the effects of your override. To do this, be as specific as possible.

### Never override tag names

Do not target tag names like `a`, `h1`, etc. The effect of such changes are much too broad. Leave this to the [`normalize`](#install-normalize) stylesheet.

### Use a custom selector

All components should allow a `className` prop to be passed so you can use your own CSS selectors. This is also true for exposed sub-components in compound component packages.

Use the `className` prop to pass your own selector. Never target the CSS selectors of a component directly.

```jsx startExpanded noRender
/* good */
<Button className="my-custom-button" />

/* bad */
// my-stylesheet.css
.psds-button {
  color: var(--that-old-orange-i-like);
}
```

### Use child selectors where needed

In some cases, you might want to override the styles of a child element. That element is not exposed as an exported subcomponent. The only way to target it is through the CSS selector it ships with. In this case, that's is ok, provided the child element is targeted as a child selector of a selector specific to your application.

```css startExpanded noRender
/* good */
.my-custom-avatar .psds-avatar__initials {
  display: none;
}

/* bad */
.psds-avatar__initials {
  display: none;
}
```

Using child combinators to target direct children or traversing nodes in selectors to get to child nodes is generally discouraged. This ties you to the implementation of the internal structure, and changes to this structure are not considered changes to the public API, are not versioned as such and could thus could break at any time.
