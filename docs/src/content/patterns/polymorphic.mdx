# Polymorphism

## `as` prop

With the polymorphic `as` prop you can replace the DOM element that will be
rendered. This is necessary when you need to change the element to meet a
semantic need, or provide a different interaction.

> NOTE: Usage of the `as` prop is a new pattern still being adopted in the Design System and therefore is not yet fully supported on all components. If you have an immediate need for component polymorphism please reach out to the Design System team so we can expedite the conversion process for your needs.

### Using a polymorphic component

One common use case for component polymorphism is to provide a more semantically
meaningful HTML element. Say for example a component that renders using a `div`
element by default but a more semantically meaningful element(like a `nav` el)
is preferred. This need can easily be accomplished using the following approach.

```typescript noRender startExpanded
import { PolymorphicDivComponent } from 'some/psds/component/path'
import { PolymorphicButton } from 'some/other/psds/component/path'
import { Link } from 'some/routing-library'

render(
  <>
    {/* NOTE: The components default behavior is to render a `div` element. */}
    <PolymorphicDivComponent />

    {/* NOTE: Using the `as` prop, you can change the component to render using
      *       a different HTMLElement that is more semantically meaningful.
      */}
    <PolymorphicDivComponent as="footer" />
    <PolymorphicDivComponent as="header" />
    <PolymorphicDivComponent as="nav" />
    <PolymorphicDivComponent as="section" />

    {/* NOTE: Using the as prop for changing Button components based on semantic
      *       need is also a common use case for polymorphism
      */}
    <PolymorphicButton as="a" />
    <PolymorphicButton as="button" />

    {/* NOTE: The `as` prop can also be used to replace the rendering element
      *       with a new React Element. This can be used to achieve greater
      *       component composition and can help when integrating with external
      *       libraries.
      */}
    <PolymorphicButton as={Link} />
  </>
)
```

### Usage with styled-components

The Design System polymorphic approach is designed to work with
`styled-components`. You should be able to compose and style any Design System
components that support polymorphism using the common `styled-components` api
patterns.

> Official [styled-component polymorphic docs](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#as-polymorphic-prop)

```typescript noRender startExpanded
import styled from "styled-components";
import { PolymorphicButton } from 'some/other/psds/component/path'

const StyledButton = styled(PolymorphicButton)`
  color: red;
`;

render(
  <>
    <StyledButton />
    <StyledButton as="a" />
    <StyledButton as="span" />
  </>
)
```

### Usage with Emotion

The Design System polymorphic approach is also designed to work with `emotion`.
You should be able to compose and style any Design System components that
supports polymorphism using the common `emotion` api patterns.

> Official [emotion polymorphic docs](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled#as-prop)

```typescript noRender startExpanded
import emotion from "@emotion/styled";
import { PolymorphicButton } from 'some/other/psds/component/path'

/* NOTE: I've had some issues with the emotion typings to fully support our
 *       polymorphic `as` typings. Below is the approach I've found works the
 *       best and avoides type errors - although it's not as clean or as helpful
 *       with it's introspections as the styled-component examples. I'm not as
 *       experienced with emotion as i would like to be...so if anyone reading
 *       this has a better approach please inform the Design System team or open
 *       an issue on github.
 *

const BaseStyledButton = emotion("button")`
  color: hotpink;
`;
const StyledButton = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, any>((props, ref) => (
  <BaseStyledButton as={PolymorphicButton} ref={ref} {...props} />
));

render(
  <>
    <StyledButton />
    <StyledButton as="a" />
    <StyledButton as="span" />
  </>
)
```

## Creating a polymorphic component

The `utils` package of the design system exports a genericized higher order
function that you can use to replace the native `React.forwardRef`. Using the
`forwardRefWithAs` utility with provide you with greater type intropection of
the `ref`, native props/attribute typings, and will include typings for the
`as` props.

```typescript noRender startExpanded
import { forwardRefWithAs } from '@pluralsight/ps-design-system-util'

const Button = forwardRefWithAs<Props, 'button'>((props, ref) => {
  const { as: Comp = 'button', ...rest } = props
  return <Comp ref={ref} {...rest} />
})
```

If you need a component that also support static properties (like for instance
you are using the compound components pattern) we provide a higher order
function to create a typesafe components with typed static properties.

```typescript noRender startExpanded
import { forwardRefWithAsAndStatics } from '@pluralsight/ps-design-system-util'

const Nested: React.FC = props => <div {...props} />

interface Statics {
  Nested: typeof Nested
}

const Compound = forwardRefWithAsAndStatics<unknown, 'div', Statics>(
  (props, ref) => {
    const { as: Comp = 'div', ...rest } = props
    return <Comp ref={ref} {...rest} />
  }
)
Compound.Nested = Nested
```

In the case you need to memoize a component, there is also a utility function
that can be used to replace the functionality of the core `React.memo` function.

```typescript noRender startExpanded
import { forwardRefWithAs, memoWithAs } from '@pluralsight/ps-design-system-util'

const ButtonImpl = forwardRefWithAs<Props, 'button'>((props, ref) => {
  const { as: Comp = 'button', ...rest } = props
  return <Comp ref={ref} {...rest} />
})

const Button = memoWithAs(ButtonImpl)

render(
  <>
    <Button />
    <Button as="a" />
  </>
)
```
